CHANGES  
- Use it section: instead of using JS to find best time, have users figure out themselves with CSS (color key, i.e.: darker = everyone more available)
<!-- - On submit: instead of switching to new tab, just clear form and pop up "Thank you for the message!" (don't actually receive/store messages) tried it on lines 80-87 but isnt working for some reason -->
- Maybe hover for team bios can be changed? Or have "on click" -> bio appear. Or just not have bios at all
- Other cool addtl feature if time: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/
