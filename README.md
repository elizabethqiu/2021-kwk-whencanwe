CHANGES  
- Use it section: instead of using JS to find best time, have users figure out themselves with CSS (color key, i.e.: darker = everyone more available)
<!-- - On submit: instead of switching to new tab, just clear form and pop up "Thank you for the message!" (don't actually receive/store messages) tried it on lines 80-87 but isnt working for some reason -->
- Maybe hover for team bios can be changed? Or have "on click" -> bio appear. Or just not have bios at all
- Other cool addtl feature if time: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/

Plan and Prepare
While planning what you will say in your demo, plan to include the following:

Introduce yourself
Share WHY you created your application
Share the technologies you used
Highlight any challenges that you came across in creating your app
Discuss what you want to do in the future
Time for questions from the audience
Also, it’s ideal that your talking points are on slides, and essential that you show the app itself:

Make sure the audience can see your screen
Create slides that highlight your talking points
Practice connecting to the screen you are presenting on
Make sure your audience can see the screen from anywhere in the room
Try It: Planning a Demo
With your group, discuss and write down your answers to the planning questions.

Then, select a Google Slides template you all like, and start making slides that highlight your talking points. Make sure to assign each slide to a group member, and make sure to give equal talking time to everyone!

Consider how you will show the functionality of your app - will you have up your real site? A giphy recording of it? Who will do the clicking, and who will do the talking? Consider every little detail.

Now that you’ve planned a demo, it’s time to practice presenting it.

You should practice your presentation multiple times.
Use a timer when you practice.
Be comfortable with the words you are using.
Try It: Planning a Demo
With your group, do a run through of the demo (or two).

If you identify any changes you'd like to make to the flow of the presentation, the content, or anything else, go ahead!

Don’t Forget: HAVE FUN!
Your audience will be so excited and proud to see the app you built and all you’ve learned. You should be proud, too.

Project your voice so everyone can hear you  
SMILE!  
Make eye contact  
Thank your audience  
Final Demo Practice  
Your instructors will schedule 1-2 practice times with you/your group before the final demos.
