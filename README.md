CHANGES  
- Use it section: instead of using JS to find best time, have users figure out themselves with CSS (color key, i.e.: darker = everyone more available)
- On submit: instead of switching to new tab, just clear form and pop up "Thank you for the message!" (don't actually receive/store messages)
- Maybe hover for team bios can be changed? Or have "on click" -> bio appear. Or just not have bios at all
